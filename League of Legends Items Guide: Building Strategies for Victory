League of Legends (LoL) is a popular multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game with deep strategy elements. One of the game’s key aspects is the items you purchase for your champion. Choosing the right items can make a huge difference in your gameplay, improving your champion’s strengths, mitigating their weaknesses, and enhancing your overall performance in battle. This guide will walk you through the basics of League of Legends items, common builds, and essential tips for itemization.

What Are Items in League of Legends?
Items in League of Legends are purchasable upgrades that provide champions with additional stats, unique abilities, and active effects. Players earn gold throughout the game, which they can spend to buy items from the shop located at their base. Item choice depends on factors like champion role, enemy team composition, and your champion’s strengths and weaknesses.

Types of Items
Items are broadly classified based on the stats they provide and their intended use. Here’s a rundown of the main item categories:

1. Starting Items
Used at the beginning of the game to gain an early advantage.
Examples: Doran’s Blade (for attack damage champions), Doran’s Ring (for mages), and Health Potions (for sustain).
2. Core Items
Essential items that define a champion's playstyle and power spike.
Examples include Infinity Edge for attack damage carries (ADCs) and Luden’s Echo for mages.
3. Legendary Items
High-value items that are built from smaller components and provide substantial stats.
Legendary items include Rabadon’s Deathcap (high ability power) and Dead Man’s Plate (armor and movement speed).
4. Mythic Items
Special, high-impact items introduced in recent seasons; you can only have one Mythic item at a time.
Each Mythic item offers a unique passive buff to other Legendary items in your inventory.
Examples: Divine Sunderer (for fighters), Everfrost (for mages), and Kraken Slayer (for ADCs).
5. Situational Items
Purchased to counter specific enemies or situations, such as heavy crowd control or burst damage.
Examples include Guardian Angel (for revival on death) and Zhonya’s Hourglass (for invulnerability).
Important Stats to Consider
Each item in League of Legends offers specific stats and effects. Here are some common stats you’ll encounter and why they matter:

Attack Damage (AD): Increases the damage of basic attacks and abilities for AD-based champions, like ADCs and some assassins.
Ability Power (AP): Boosts the power of magic-based abilities, often used by mages and AP-focused champions.
Armor and Magic Resist: Reduces damage from physical and magic attacks, respectively, improving a champion's durability.
Health and Mana: Provides more HP and MP for survivability and ability usage.
Life Steal and Spell Vamp: Restores health based on the damage dealt, making champions more sustainable.
Cooldown Reduction (Ability Haste): Reduces the cooldown time of abilities, allowing more frequent use.
Common Builds by Champion Role
Each champion role has common builds to maximize effectiveness. Here’s an overview for each main role:

Top Lane
Tanks: Prioritize durability items like Sunfire Aegis, Thornmail, and Spirit Visage.
Bruisers: Mix of offensive and defensive items, such as Black Cleaver and Death’s Dance.
Jungle
Tank Junglers: Build tanky items like Turbo Chemtank and Dead Man’s Plate.
AD Assassins: Focus on high-damage items, including Duskblade of Draktharr and Youmuu’s Ghostblade.
Mid Lane
Mages: Go for AP items like Luden’s Echo, Zhonya’s Hourglass, and Rabadon’s Deathcap.
Assassins: Focus on burst-damage items like Prowler’s Claw and Edge of Night.
ADC (Bot Lane)
Marksmen: Build high AD and critical strike items like Kraken Slayer, Infinity Edge, and Bloodthirster.
Support
Enchanters: Build items to protect allies, like Moonstone Renewer and Ardent Censer.
Tank Supports: Use durable items, including Locket of the Iron Solari and Knight’s Vow.
How to Decide on Item Builds in-Game
Building items effectively involves adapting to the current game. Here are some tips for itemization based on in-game factors:

Assess Enemy Damage: If the enemy team has a lot of AP, consider buying Magic Resist items like Banshee’s Veil or Force of Nature. Against AD-heavy teams, Thornmail or Randuin’s Omen are solid choices.

Counter Enemy Champions: Certain champions have hard counters in the form of items. For example, Executioner's Calling reduces healing effects, making it essential against champions with high sustain, like Dr. Mundo or Vladimir.

Adapt to Your Champion’s Power Spike: Each champion has certain items that significantly boost their power. For instance, Rabadon’s Deathcap for mages or Essence Reaver for AD casters.

Consider Team Composition: If your team needs more durability, consider building items that protect your teammates, like Redemption or Locket of the Iron Solari for support champions.

Popular Items and Their Uses
Here are some of the most popular items and why they’re commonly chosen:

Infinity Edge: High critical strike and damage for ADCs.
Sunfire Aegis: Boosts tank damage while providing survivability.
Rabadon’s Deathcap: Drastically increases AP for mages, enhancing their damage.
Sterak’s Gage: Provides durability and a shield, ideal for fighters.
Guardian Angel: Offers a second chance by reviving you upon death, useful for high-priority champions.
Tips for Mastering Itemization
Learn Your Champion’s Itemization: Every champion has a specific set of core items. Familiarize yourself with these to know when and why they’re effective.
Stay Up-to-Date with Patch Notes: League of Legends is regularly updated, and items are frequently balanced or changed. Keep track of patch notes to stay current.
Experiment in Practice Tool: The practice tool in League of Legends allows you to test out builds, understand their impact, and find what works best for your playstyle.
Conclusion
Mastering items in League of Legends can be challenging but highly rewarding. With practice and familiarity, you’ll find the best builds to maximize your champion’s potential in every game. Good luck, and happy gaming!
